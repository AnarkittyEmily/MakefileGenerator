# MakefileGenerator
Basically a makefile generator, if you want to fork this or contribute to it, they are welcome! Your forks should not be proprietary.

There are three options, adding a new build task, modifying it, and showing your current build task.

The modifying option is a little inconvenient, I'd love to get advice on how to make it better.
